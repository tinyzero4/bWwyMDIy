# Midterm project

# Project context

Since 1998, when NASA kicked off the biggest search for near-Earth asteroids, scientists have detected more than 25,000 of them. And 2020 turned out to be a record year for discoveries. Despite the pandemic interrupting many of the surveys, astronomers catalogued 2,958 previously unknown near-Earth asteroids over the course of the year (see ‘Space rocks’). All of these discoveries are making astronomers more conscious of the billiard-ball nature of the Solar System, where plenty of asteroids ping around in the space near Earth. 
In this project we are going to build a model to predict hazardous/non-hazardous asteroids in order to submit proper reaction on discovery(e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis)
